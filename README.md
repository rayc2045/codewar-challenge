### What is Codewars?

[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) is an educational community for computer programming. On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages, and are completed within an online integrated development environment. On Codewars the community and challenge progression is gamified, with users earning ranks and honor for completing kata, contributing kata, and quality solutions.

### Sharpen your skills

Challenge yourself on kata, created by the community to strengthen different skills. Master your current language of choice, or expand your understanding of a new one.

### Train on kata

Solve the kata with your coding style right in the browser and use test cases (TDD) to check it as you progress. Retrain with new, creative, and optimized approaches.

### Earn ranks and honor

Kata are ranked to approximate difficulty. As you complete higher ranked kata, you progress through the ranks so we can match you with relevant challenges.

### Gain collaborative wisdom

Compare your solution with others after each kata for greater understanding. Discuss the kata, best practices, and innovative techniques with the community.

### Create your own kata

Author kata that focus on your interests and train specific skillsets. Challenge the community with your insight and code understanding.
